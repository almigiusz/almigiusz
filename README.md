## Hi üëã
My name is **Kacper**, and I am a passionate front-end developer from Poland. My programming journey began in 2019, and I am passionate about the frontend from a technical standpoint, as well as artistic projects, an example of which can be found on my website.

As an ambivert, I have a balanced mix of introverted and extroverted qualities. This allows me to excel at both individual work and collaboration with others. I can easily adapt to different situations and communicate effectively with a wide range of people.

Frontend is not only a future plan for me, but also a love that absorbs most of my time, so I believe that collaboration with me would be highly beneficial. As an enthusiast, I take great care in maintaining a high-quality portfolio and in delivering outstanding results for my projects.
