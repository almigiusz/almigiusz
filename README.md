## Hi 👋
My name is **Kacper**, and I used to be a passionate front-end developer. I started my programming journey in 2019 and was highly interested in the frontend from a technical and artistic perspective.

Since 2023, I have shifted my focus entirely to backend development and have moved away from the frontend. However, I occasionally work on frontend projects for personal enjoyment or when the need arises. Nonetheless, my primary area of expertise and interest lies in backend development.

As an ambivert, I have a balanced mix of introverted and extroverted qualities, which enables me to excel at both individual work and collaborative efforts. I am highly adaptable to new situations and can effectively communicate with a diverse range of people.

It is a Discord bot written in Node.js and utilizing the discord.js library. As of April 2023, I have started developing a web application to streamline the management of the bot on my website. I am using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for this.
